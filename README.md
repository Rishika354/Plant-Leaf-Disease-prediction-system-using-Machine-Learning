Project Goal: To classify different plant diseases, we plan to design a deep learning system so that a person without expertise in software should also be able to use it easily. The proposed system is made to predict plant diseases using the leaves as an identifying factor. It explains the analysis of our methodology along with some of the feature engineering of the data. A large number of images is collected for each disease and is classified into database images and input images. The primary attributes of the leaves that are important are the shape and texture-oriented features. The figure provided below gives us an insight into the basic principle of our system along with an idea about how the system works.
